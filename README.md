# SurfacePro3-Windows7
An attempt at porting Windows 7 to a Surface Pro 3
### How was this possible?
Thanks to the lessmsi package, decompiling the driver pack was easy, but porting it to Windows 7? That's the hard part as the driver pack only officially supports Windows 10 Pro, which is an issue as Windows 7 doesn't share the same kernel as Windows 10.  


### How do i get the extracted driver pack?
You can download it from this google drive link! https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YoH4wchLT50oD8nVI0Yoj2oTFEVnSAv/view?usp=drive_link
