# SurfacePro3-Windows7
An attempt at porting Windows 7 to a Surface Pro 3
### How was this possible?
Thanks to the lessmsi package, decompiling the driver pack was easy, but porting it to Windows 7? That's the hard part as the driver pack only officially supports Windows 10 Pro, so how did I get passed that? I fully decompiled the driver pack and made a note of the (potentially) compatible drivers and began testing it.

### How did you install Windows 7 in the first place?
Thanks to the uefiseven repo, I was able to bypass the BCD errors you would usually get

### How do i get the extracted driver pack?
You can download it from this google drive link! https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YoH4wchLT50oD8nVI0Yoj2oTFEVnSAv/view?usp=drive_link
